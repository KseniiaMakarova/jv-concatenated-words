# jv-concatenated-words

We have provided a file which contains a sorted list of words. 
The words are listed one word per line, do not contain spaces, and are all lowercase. 

Your task is to write a program that reads the file and provides the following:

- the longest concatenated word (that is, the longest word that is comprised entirely of shorter words in the file)
- the 2nd longest concatenated word
- the total count of all the concatenated words in the file
